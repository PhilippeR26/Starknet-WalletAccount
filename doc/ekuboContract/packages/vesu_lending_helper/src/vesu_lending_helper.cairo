//! Vesu lending helper for privacy-preserving deposit and withdraw operations.
//!
//! Integrates with [Vesu](https://vesu.xyz), a permissionless lending protocol on Starknet that
//! uses ERC-4626 / SNIP-22 compatible tokenized vaults. Each pool is a vault: depositing underlying
//! assets mints share tokens; withdrawing burns shares and returns underlying.
//!
//! ## Contract call details
//!
//! **Deposit** (underlying → shares): Calls `deposit(assets: u256, receiver: ContractAddress)` on
//! the vault (`out_token`). The vault pulls `in_token` (underlying) from the caller after prior
//! approval.
//!
//! **Withdraw** (shares → underlying): Calls `withdraw(assets: u256, receiver: ContractAddress,
//! owner: ContractAddress)` on the vault (`in_token`). Burns shares from `owner` and sends
//! underlying to `receiver`.

    /// Can be called by the privacy contract via the
    /// [`INVOKE_SELECTOR`](privacy::utils::constants::INVOKE_SELECTOR) selector.
    ///
    /// #### Parameters
    /// - `operation` ([`LendingOperation`](LendingOperation)) - The lending operation to perform.
    /// - `in_token` (`ContractAddress`) - The token address of the input funds (in withdraw -
    /// vToken).
    /// - `out_token` (`ContractAddress`) - The token address of the output funds (in deposit -
    /// vToken).
    /// - `assets` (`u256`) - amount of assets to deposit/withdraw.
    /// - `note_id` (`felt252`) - The identifier of the open note to deposit the output to.
    ///
    /// #### Returns
    /// - ([`Span<OpenNoteDeposit>`](privacy::objects::OpenNoteDeposit)) - span of deposits for the
    /// privacy contract to apply.
    ///
    /// #### Preconditions
    /// - `in_token` must not be zero.
    /// - `out_token` must not be zero.
    /// - `assets` must not be zero.
    /// - `in_token` must not be equal to `out_token`.
    /// - The contract must have sufficient input token balance.
    /// - On deposit, `out_token` must be a Vesu Token contract.
    /// - On withdraw, `in_token` must be a Vesu Token contract.
    ///
    /// #### Flow
    /// 1. If operation is Deposit, approves Vesu Token contract to spend `in_amount` of in tokens.
    /// 2. Records output token balance, calls the corresponding lending function, calculates
    /// received amount.
    /// 3. Approves the caller (privacy contract) to transfer the received output funds.
    /// 4. Returns (note_id, out_token, out_amount).
